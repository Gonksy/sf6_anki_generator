## Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to parse frame data for Street Fighter 6 from [FAT's SF6 spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JncPFer0RELkKvA9boqHzZ7SqvqTNiX9QLOy9QKzEOM/) and automatically generate question sets in .csv format to be imported into Anki.

## Supplementary component for another app I'm building

The questions generated by this tool will also power an application I'm building aimed at helping SF6 players memorize frame data consistently.

## Optimizations

This tool is still in early stages of development.
